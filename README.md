# AI-driven Workflow

This is my take on an AI-driven workflow — a way to structure projects before jumping into code. I like to start by clarifying the vision and motivation, writing SOP/SOW, and planning architecture, coding standards, and project structure. I also try to use AI wherever it can help with planning, documentation, or repetitive tasks.

For me, the goal is simple: reduce chaos, avoid technical debt, and have a clear workflow that actually works in real projects. Markdown examples and clear guidelines help me stay on track.

## Vision
Before writing any code, clearly define the vision for the project. This sets the direction and long-term goals, ensuring everyone understands the purpose and desired impact.

## Motivation
Clarify the motivation behind the project. Explain why this project matters, what problems it solves, and the value it brings.

## Statement of Work (SOW) / Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
Outline the scope, deliverables, and standard processes for the project. This step ensures that all contributors know what needs to be done and how to approach the work.

## Coding Guidelines, Patterns, and Structure
Define coding standards, architectural patterns, and the overall project structure before starting development. This helps maintain consistency, quality, and scalability.

## Repetitive Tasks and Examples
Identify repetitive or common tasks and document them separately. Provide multiple examples in markdown to illustrate best practices and reusable patterns.

### Project Description
This repository, "AI-driven Workflow," demonstrates a disciplined and structured approach to starting and managing projects. Instead of jumping straight into coding, it emphasizes the importance of:

1. Writing a clear vision statement
2. Defining the motivation
3. Creating SOW or SOP documents
4. Establishing coding guidelines, patterns, and structure
5. Documenting repetitive tasks with multiple markdown examples

By following this workflow, you ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability from the very beginning. This approach is especially valuable for AI-driven projects, where planning and structure are critical for long-term success.
