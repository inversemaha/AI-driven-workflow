# Motivation

## Why This Project Exists

Manual job searching is inefficient and repetitive. Most job listings are partially relevant, resulting in wasted time and low-quality applications.

As a senior engineer, I want:

- Intelligent filtering instead of keyword matching
- Data-driven job selection
- Automated tracking
- Controlled, high-quality applications

## Core Motivation

- Reduce 1–2 hours daily manual searching
- Increase quality of applications
- Improve interview conversion rate
- Build reusable AI-driven architecture
